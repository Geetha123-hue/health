# Goal Description
Develop an Urban AI Healthcare Web Application offering symptom recognition, disease prediction, preventive care guidance, and emergency support. The system will consist of a React frontend, a Node.js/Express backend for business logic, and a Python microservice for AI inference.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> Since we do not have external API keys like Twilio for OTP or OpenAI for Whisper, we will implement OTP via a mock simulated service and Voice-to-Text via the native Browser Web Speech API.

## Proposed Changes

### Database Layer
- Set up a lightweight **SQLite** database to prevent complex local setups, using tables for `Users`, `Symptoms`, `Predictions`, and `Hospitals`.

### Backend Service (Node.js / Express)
- `server.js`: Entry point
- **Authentication**: Endpoints for `/signup` and `/login` (using local JWT).
- **Domain logic**: Routes for user profile CRUD and mock analytics data generation.
- **Proxy**: Forwarding prediction requests to the Python AI service.

### AI Microservice (Python / FastAPI)
- `main.py`: Entry point exposing the `/predict` endpoint.
- `model.py`: Script to generate a dummy dataset of symptoms mapped to diseases and train a `scikit-learn` Random Forest Classifier. Once trained, the model will run inference on user symptoms and return disease plus dummy medications.

### Frontend Service (React / Vite)
- **UI Architecture**: Built purely with Vanilla CSS for a dynamic, vibrant, modern, high aesthetic design (glassmorphism, smooth gradients, subtle animations).
- **Core Pages**:
  - `Login / Signup`: Engaging and smooth authentication flows.
  - `Dashboard`: Categories and visually pleasing navigation.
  - `Symptom Checker`: Native Web Speech API integration for voice-to-text.
  - `Predictions`: A visually rich breakdown of severity levels and healthcare guidance.
  - `Analytics`: Simple metrics visualized for admins or general trends.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run dev` and python uvicorn.
- Test endpoint health (Backend & AI).

### Manual Verification
- Walk through the user flow: Create an account -> View Dashboard -> Speak symptoms using Voice Input -> View AI-Predicted Result -> View disease severity and recommendations.
